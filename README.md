This is hobby/learning Project in early prototype that I might go back to, I have added a lot more new mechanics , You can now use this code for your own projects.



## ‚ö†Ô∏è Be Aware‚ö†Ô∏è

This is early Prototype code so bugs and crashes may happen.

For the destruction to work which uses Chaos Destruction please make sure you enable the following plugins with in UE5

- Field System 
- Chaos Destruction


## Mechanics

- Destructible Environment
- Projectiles are limited 
- Ammo Pickups - Gives x amount of ammo on pickup(Default:10)
- Repair Packs Pickups - Can be held for when needed, Press E to use repair pack. Also Limits the amount of packs you can carry(Default:2)
- Landmines - Adds more sense of danger. Landmines can be destroyed or when you roll over a landmine it deals x amount of damage.
- Damage States - There is currently 3 states normal, damaged and critical. Depending on the state your in your movment will reduce by X amount if you are in critical you cant move at all



## üõ£Ô∏è Roadmap

- Create state Machine to utilize the different states.

- Right now when you are in critical state you can not move but will implement emergency repair system so after X amount of systems it gives back X amount of health to get you the the closest repair kit.

- lots and lots of refactoring.

- Plus more.
